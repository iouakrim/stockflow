You are building the SaaS project "StockFlow Pro".

Step 1:
Review and analyze the full UI design generated in Stitch.( project stockflow)
Carefully extract:
- Layout structure
- Components
- Page hierarchy
- Navigation patterns
- Mobile behavior (bottom navigation)
- Responsive rules

Step 2:
Review all existing technical specifications provided earlier, including:
- Tech stack
- Database schema
- Business rules
- Architecture requirements
- Multi-tenant constraints
- PWA and mobile requirements

Step 3:
Before writing any code, create a structured implementation plan.

The plan must include:

1. Application architecture overview
2. Folder structure strategy
3. Database schema validation and improvements
4. Feature breakdown by module
5. Page-by-page implementation roadmap
6. Shared components strategy
7. Mobile responsive strategy
8. State management approach
9. API layer organization
10. Security and RLS implementation plan
11. Performance optimization strategy

Do NOT start coding yet.

First output:
- A complete technical implementation roadmap
- Ordered development phases
- Clear priority structure (MVP → Phase 2 → Scale)

Be precise, structured, and production-oriented.
Think like a senior SaaS architect.
